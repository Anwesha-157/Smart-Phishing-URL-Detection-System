# Introduction
The rapid evolution of the digital landscape has ushered in 
unprecedented opportunities for communication, commerce, and 
collaboration. However, this interconnectedness has also given rise to a 
burgeoning threatâ€”phishing attacks. Phishing is a kind of Cybercrime 
trying to obtain important or confidential information from users which 
is usually carried out by creating a counterfeit website that mimics a 
legitimate website. 
The goal of phishing is usually to trick individuals into providing 
sensitive information, such as login credentials, personal details, or 
financial information.
This project, titled "SMART PHISHING URL DETECTION SYSTEM" is a proactive 
endeavor to fortify the defenses against phishing threats by harnessing 
the power of machine learning.

# Objective
A phishing url detection project aims to develop and implement mechanisms to identify and thwart malicious websites, reducing the risk of identity theft and financial fraud. The objective of our project is to inform the user whether the url is safe or not before using it. It can detect how much secure a site is to use.
